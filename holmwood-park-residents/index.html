    <!-- Why Take Action? -->

        <h2 class="section-header">🚨 Why Take Action?</h2>
        
        <div class="inner-container">
            <p><strong>Holmwood Residents Limited</strong> is the company responsible for managing our estate, yet residents currently have <strong>little to no say</strong> in how key decisions are made.</p>
            <p>At present, <strong>Trinity Estates</strong>—a third-party management company—holds control over our estate’s financial decisions, policies, and maintenance contracts. As residents, we are <strong>paying for services that we have no control over</strong>, and many of us have noticed issues with the way our estate is being managed.</p>
            <div class="issues-grid">
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>⚠ Neglected Repairs</h3>
                    <p>Residents have reported broken speed humps that remain unfixed, while essential maintenance is delayed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>💸 Unnecessary Spending</h3>
                    <p>Money has been spent on painting new road markings and 20mph speed signs—changes that nobody appears to have requested.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>🚫 No Consultation</h3>
                    <p>These decisions impact our community, yet they are made without our input or transparency.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Without resident oversight, we risk <strong>further unnecessary spending, rising service charges, and poor management</strong> that does not reflect our needs or priorities. The more members we have in Holmwood Residents Limited, the stronger our collective voice will be.</p>

            <p class="cta-text"><strong>If we don’t take action, who will? Now is the time to step forward and take control of the place we call home.</strong></p>
