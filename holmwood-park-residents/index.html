        <h2 class="section-header">🚨 Why Take Action?</h2>
        
        <div class="inner-container">
            <p><strong>Holmwood Residents Limited</strong> is the company responsible for managing our estate, yet residents currently have <strong>little to no say</strong> in how key decisions are made.</p>
            <p>At present, <strong>Trinity Estates</strong>—a third-party management company—holds control over our estate’s financial decisions, policies, and maintenance contracts. As residents, we are <strong>paying for services that we have no control over</strong>, and many of us have noticed issues with the way our estate is being managed.</p>
            <div class="issues-grid">
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>⚠ Neglected Repairs</h3>
                    <p>Residents have reported broken speed humps that remain unfixed, while essential maintenance is delayed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>💸 Unnecessary Spending</h3>
                    <p>Money has been spent on painting new road markings and 20mph speed signs—changes that nobody appears to have requested.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>🚫 No Consultation</h3>
                    <p>These decisions impact our community, yet they are made without our input or transparency.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Without resident oversight, we risk <strong>further unnecessary spending, rising service charges, and poor management</strong> that does not reflect our needs or priorities. The more members we have in Holmwood Residents Limited, the stronger our collective voice will be.</p>

            <p class="cta-text"><strong>If we don’t take action, who will? Now is the time to step forward and take control of the place we call home.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="section-header">🔹 Why Should You Become a Member?</h2>
        <div class="inner-container">

            <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong> Every Holmwood Park homeowner has the right to apply for membership in Holmwood Residents Ltd. This membership isn’t automatic – you need to apply – but the company’s rules guarantee that any qualifying homeowner can join. Once you’re a member, you have legal rights in the company’s governance, including voting at meetings and accessing company information.</p>

            <div class="issues-grid">

                <div class="benefit-card fade-in">
                    <h3>Voting Power in Decisions</h3>
                    <p>Members can vote on important decisions at annual general meetings or through written resolutions. You’ll have a say in budgets, policies, and which managing agents or contractors are hired.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="benefit-card fade-in">
                    <h3>Community Decision-Making</h3>
                    <p>With more members, our community gains control. Rather than an outside company deciding everything, we as residents can collectively determine how to maintain and improve our estate.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="benefit-card fade-in">
                    <h3>Financial Transparency</h3>
                    <p>As a member, you can access the company’s accounts and see exactly how your estate charges are being used. No more mysteries – you can help ensure money is spent wisely on the park, roads, lighting, and other services you care about.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="benefit-card fade-in">
                    <h3>Accountability for Managers</h3>
                    <p>Holmwood Residents Ltd can appoint or dismiss the property management company. When homeowners are in charge, the managing agent answers to <i>us</i>. If the managing agent isn’t performing or costs are unreasonable, members can push for changes. In short, you can hold property managers accountable through the residents’ company.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="benefit-card fade-in">
                    <h3>Protecting Your Investment</h3>
                    <p>Having control means protecting the value of your home. You and your neighbors will make decisions that prevent neglect or excessive fees that could hurt property values. It’s local stewardship by the people who live here and care most.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="benefit-card fade-in">
                    <h3>Building Community</h3>
                    <p>Working together with your neighbors through the company builds a stronger community. You’ll meet fellow residents, share ideas, and collaborate to make Holmwood Park an even better place to live.</p>
                </div>

            </div>

            <p>Overall, joining Holmwood Residents Ltd empowers you with information and influence that non-member homeowners won’t have. It’s your estate – membership ensures you have a voice in its future.</p>
