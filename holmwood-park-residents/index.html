    <!-- Why Become a Member? -->
    <section class="info-section">
        <h2>What Does It Mean to Be a Member?</h2>
        <p>Becoming a member of <strong>Holmwood Residents Limited</strong> gives you a voice in the decisions that impact our estate. Right now, external companies are making choices on our behalf, often with **little transparency or input from residents**.</p>
    
        <h3>üîπ Why Should You Become a Member?</h3>
        <p>By becoming a member, you **gain the power to**:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vote on key decisions affecting our homes, service charges, and management.</li>
            <li>Hold property managers accountable for fair pricing and service quality.</li>
            <li>Ensure that **residents, not third parties**, are in control of estate decisions.</li>
            <li>Make sure **maintenance fees are used efficiently** rather than wasted.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>üè° What Happens Without Resident Control?</h3>
        <p>Without resident involvement, an external management company can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increase service charges without justification.</li>
            <li>Hire expensive contractors without consulting residents.</li>
            <li>Ignore maintenance concerns or delay essential repairs.</li>
            <li>Refuse to disclose how our fees are being spent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>By becoming a member, you help prevent this and ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of the residents.</strong></p>
    
        <h3>‚öñ Who Can Join?</h3>
        <p>Membership is open to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Private homeowners (leasehold or freehold).</li>
            <li>Leaseholders from housing associations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Unfortunately, renters do not qualify.</strong> However, they can support our efforts by encouraging their landlords to sign up.</p>
    
        <h3>‚è≥ Is This a Big Commitment?</h3>
        <p>Not at all! Being a member <strong>does not require day-to-day involvement</strong>. Your main responsibility is to <strong>vote on key decisions</strong>, such as electing directors who oversee estate management.</p>
        <p>Even if you don‚Äôt want to be directly involved, <strong>simply signing up gives us more power to make positive changes.</strong></p>
