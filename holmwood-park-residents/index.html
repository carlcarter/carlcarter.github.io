        <div class="inner-container">
            <p>If you own a property in Holmwood Park, you are automatically a <strong>potential member</strong> of Holmwood Residents Ltd. In the company’s terms, you’re a “Unitholder” – meaning you hold the lease or freehold for a home on the estate. As a Unitholder, you have the right to become a member of the residents’ company. By joining, you gain a voice in how our community is managed. This site explains your rights, the benefits of joining, and how to sign up.</p>
            <p><strong>Holmwood Residents Limited</strong> is the company responsible for managing our estate, yet residents currently have <strong>little to no say</strong> in how key decisions are made.</p>
            <p>At present, <strong>Trinity Estates</strong> - a third-party management company - holds control over our estate’s financial decisions, policies, and maintenance contracts. As residents, we are <strong>paying for services that we have no control over</strong>, and many of us have noticed issues with the way our estate is being managed.</p>
            <div class="issues-grid">
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>⚠ Neglected Repairs</h3>
                    <p>Residents have reported broken speed humps that have been fixed poorly, while essential maintenance is delayed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>💸 Unnecessary Spending</h3>
                    <p>Money has been spent on painting new road markings and 20mph speed signs—changes that nobody appears to have requested.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qualification-card not-qualified fade-in">
                    <h3>🚫 No Consultation</h3>
                    <p>These decisions impact our community, yet they are made without our input or transparency.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Without resident oversight, we risk <strong>further unnecessary spending, rising service charges, and poor management</strong> that does not reflect our needs or priorities. The more members we have in Holmwood Residents Limited, the stronger our collective voice will be.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">🔹 Why Should You Become a Member?</h2>
        <div class="inner-container">

            <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong> Every Holmwood Park homeowner has the right to apply for membership in Holmwood Residents Ltd.

Once you’re a member, you have legal rights in the company’s governance, including voting at meetings and accessing company information.</p>

                </div>

                    <h3>Community Decision-Making</h3>

                    <p>Holmwood Residents Ltd can appoint or dismiss the property management company. When homeowners are in charge, the managing agent answers to <i>us</i>.

        <h2 class="section-header">FAQs</h2>
        
        <div class="inner-container">

            <p>We know you might have some questions or concerns. Here are answers to some common FAQs about Holmwood Residents Ltd, homeowner rights, and what all this means for you and the estate:</p>

            <button class="accordion"><strong>Q: What exactly is Holmwood Residents Ltd?</strong></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><i>A:</i> It’s a company that was set up to manage the Holmwood Park estate. Think of it as a residents’ management company. Initially, the developer (Bellway Homes) managed it, but the idea is that homeowners can take over through this company. Each homeowner can become a member and collectively own and run the company. Holmwood Residents Ltd doesn’t make a profit – it’s there to handle things like maintenance of communal areas, insurance, and appointing managing agents, on behalf of all residents.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion"><strong>Q: Is this legal? Can homeowners really take control?</strong></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><i>A:</i> Yes, absolutely – it’s not only legal, it’s the intended plan for our estate! The development’s legal documents explicitly give owners the right to join the company and eventually assume control. Many modern housing estates are set up this way. It ensures that once the builder is done, residents can self-manage. We’re simply exercising that right. We’ll still follow all laws and regulations (for example, company law for running the company, and property law for managing the estate).</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion"><strong>Q: What are the obligations of being a member?</strong></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><i>A:</i> The obligations are minimal. There’s no membership fee or subscription. (As a company limited by guarantee, each member’s liability is capped at a nominal £1 in the extremely unlikely event the company had to be wound up.) Your main obligations are to follow the company’s rules (the Articles of Association) – which basically means acting in the company’s interest, and continuing to pay your normal estate charges. By law, you also need to act in good faith as a member. Practically speaking, if you join, you should participate by voting at meetings (or by proxy if you can’t attend) and respect the collective decisions made. If you become a director, there are director duties – but ordinary members do not have to become directors or take on active management tasks if they don’t want to.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion"><strong>Q: If I join, do I have to do any work or take on responsibilities?</strong></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><i>A:</i> Not if you don’t want to. Joining as a member doesn’t mean you’re volunteering for a job – it’s more like becoming a shareholder in a mutual company (except there’s no dividend, just communal benefit). You can choose to stand for the board of directors at the annual election if you’re passionate about directly managing things – and we encourage enthusiastic volunteers – but it’s totally optional. Many members will simply cast their votes at the AGM and otherwise go about their lives. The day-to-day operations (like arranging maintenance or handling finances) can be delegated to a professional managing agent that the members oversee. So you can be as involved or as hands-off as you like, knowing that just by joining, you’ve strengthened the resident community’s control.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion"><strong>Q: How many homeowners need to join for us to take control?</strong></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><i>A:</i> The more the better! There isn’t a strict number required in the Articles, but practically, we’d love to have a majority of homeowners on board. When most owners are members, we can call a general meeting, elect resident directors, and effectively take over decision-making. Our goal is 100% of homeowners eventually, but reaching anything over 50% would be a huge milestone that gives residents clear control. Every member counts – your participation could literally tip the balance toward self-management!</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion"><strong>Q: What if some homeowners don’t want to join?</strong></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><i>A:</i> It’s their choice – membership isn’t legally mandatory. However, non-members will still be bound by the decisions Holmwood Residents Ltd makes (since it manages the estate for all). They’ll still pay the same fees but won’t have a vote or insight. We hope to show every homeowner that it’s in their interest to join. If a neighbor is hesitant, maybe they don’t understand the benefits or are worried it’s complicated. Feel free to share this website with them or have a chat – sometimes a friendly conversation can address their concerns. In the end, decisions will be made by those who participate. We don’t want anyone left out or feeling unrepresented, so we’ll keep encouraging sign-ups. And even if someone opts out, we will still act in all residents’ best interests. They will benefit from what the rest of us achieve – they just won’t have had a say in shaping it.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion"><strong>Q: What happens if we don’t take control and things stay under external management?</strong></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><i>A:</i> If homeowners do nothing, the estate will continue under the current structure – likely managed by a company chosen by the developer. In that scenario, you (and all residents) keep paying fees but have no say in how that money is used. The managing agent could remain the same indefinitely. Staying under external management keeps the status quo. It might be okay for a while if the current agent is decent, but it leaves homeowners powerless to change anything. Taking control through membership gives us the flexibility to change managing agents, adjust budgets, and address issues proactively.</p>
