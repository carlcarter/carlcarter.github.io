**Subject: Request for Membership in Holmwood Residents Limited**  

Dear [Company Secretary],  

I am writing to formally request membership in Holmwood Residents Limited in accordance with the company‚Äôs Articles of Association.  
As [a freehold homeowner] OR [a leaseholder of a property within the estate], I qualify for membership and wish to exercise my right to participate in decisions that affect our shared development.  

I understand that membership will grant me the right to vote on key matters regarding estate management, service charges, and the appointment of directors.  
Given that this directly impacts my property and financial obligations, I believe it is essential that residents have a say in how the estate is run.  

I kindly request that my application for membership be processed promptly. Please confirm receipt of this request and provide any necessary next steps.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Address]
